<h1>Projects</h1>

Here are some of the projects I've developed over the years.

<!-------------------------------->

<h2><a href="/projects/nes/">Multi-platform NES emulator</a></h2>

<a href="/projects/nes/"><img src="/static/images/nes.png" class="go-left" /></a>

<p>Open-source Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator built with Rust.
  It can be compiled both to native targets and to the web using WebAssembly.</p>

<p>You can find the web version <a href="/projects/nes/">here</a> and the source code <a
    href="https://github.com/edusporto/nes">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The only preloaded game is called <a href="https://github.com/xram64/falling-nes">Falling</a> by Jesse Williams (<a
    href="https://github.com/xram64">@xram64</a> on GitHub).</p>

<h2 style="clear: both;"><a href="/projects/daltonik/Daltonik.pdf">Assistive Technology for Colorblind People</a></h2>

<a href="/projects/daltonik/Daltonik.pdf">
  <img src="/static/images/daltonik.jpg" class="go-left" />
</a>

<p>Developed by myself, <a href="https://github.com/LucaDillenburg">Luca Dillenburg</a>, and <a
    href="https://github.com/fabiofaundes">Fábio Faúndes</a>, Daltonik is a set of tools targeting
  Android smartphones utilizing image processing and computer vision to help colorblind people on color-focused
  activities.</p>

<p>It consists of three tools: <i>substitution of colors to patterns</i>, <i>color filtering</i>, and <i>color
    identification</i>.</p>

<p>We won first place at <a href="https://spo.ifsp.edu.br/sedcitecjr?id=1777">Sedcitec Jr 2019</a> and also presented
  the project at <a href="https://www.mostratec.com.br/edicao-2019/">Mostratec 2019</a> and <a
    href="https://feirabragantec.com.br/">Bragantec 2019</a>.</p>

<p>The project's code is unfortunately not yet open-source, but you can find a description of each tool below.</p>

    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p>Being able to understand information displayed on maps, charts, and other color-coded medias is a critical
      skill ranging many aspects of life, such as work, college, or even just getting around town. Unfortunately, it is
      common for such media to not be accessible to colorblind people, making this task very difficult for them.</p>

    <h3>Our solution</h3>
    <p>The algorithm we developed groups pixels by color and turns each group into a different geometric
      pattern, so that a given image can convey information without depending solely on color.</p>

    <p>You can find a demo of the tool on this section.</p>

  <details style="clear: both;">
    <summary style="cursor: default; user-select: none; padding-bottom: 5px;"><b>Color filtering</b></summary>
    <img class="go-left" src="static/images/filter-colorblind-toolset.png" loading="lazy" />

    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is be necessary for a person to identify the difference between colors and the shapes
      they take. The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test">Ishihara test</a> presents
      circular images with different-colored dots that, together, form some kind of number or other shape which
      colorblind people may not be able to determine. This test can be used to classify different types of color
      blindness, and they look a bit "mysterious" to people with this type of vision deficiency, since they
      can't see what is expected of them.
    </p>
    <h3>Our solution</h3>
    <p>
      We developed a tool that categorizes different but similar colors (to colorblind people) and filters them
      so they can be easily distinguished. The example image shows an application as a way to help someone understand
      the expected result of an Ishihara test.

  <details style="clear: both;">
    <summary style="cursor: default; user-select: none; padding-bottom: 5px;"><b>Color identification</b></summary>
    <img class="go-left" src="static/images/id-colorblind-toolset.jpg" loading="lazy" />

    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons why a colorblind person would want to know the color of an object.
      They may want to know if a banana is ripe, or the color of a shirt to try and match clothes.
      In these situations, there's little to do but to ask for help from another person.
    </p>

    <h3>Our solution</h3>
    <p>
      This tool displays the names of the colors inside the square at the center of the screen, and can be configured
      by the user for their specific needs.
