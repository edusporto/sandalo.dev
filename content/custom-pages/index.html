<h1>Hi!</h1>

<img class="profile" src="/static/images/eu.jpg"/>

<p>I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/">University of SÃ£o Paulo</a>.</p>

<p>My main research interests are regarding the theory and design of programming languages. I enjoy working with functional languages and I find it important to have both strong theoretical foundations for software development as well as practical knowledge.</p>

<p>This page is still under construction. Be sure to check out my <a href="/cv.pdf">curriculum vitae</a> as well as some of my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> and <a href="posts.html">blog posts</a>.</p>
